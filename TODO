* Find out whether the linear scaling performed here is the Right Thing(TM)

* Allow the user to select which joysticks should be used. A module option
  would be a good start. A /proc entry is probably the best alternative:
  e.g. 

    echo "usb-0000:00:1d.7-3.3/input0" > /proc/kjscal/enable
    
  could enable kjscal for the joystick with dev.phys == "usb-0000:00:1d.7-3.3/input0"

* A /proc entry with information such as the current rmin/rmax values for
  each axis e.t.c.

* Full-blown joystick event remapping (e.g. swap axis 3 and 4). This should be
  in another module - after all the "kjscal" name pretty much sets the scope of
  this one, but suggestions are welcome.
