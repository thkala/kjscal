Fri Apr 28 15:03:17 EEST 2006 - Theodoros V. Kalamatianos <nyb@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Release 0.1.4
	* Added a big fat Black Magic warning in the code to notify potential
	  readers that things are not done as they should and that this code
	  is just a hack and nothing more.
	* Fixed an Oops with kernel versions >= 2.6.15. The fact that this bug
	  was not reported, despite it being a real showstopper, probably means
	  that kjscal is not very popular :-). Well, not everyone can have a
	  killer project.
